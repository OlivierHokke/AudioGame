/// Defines the data specific to a particular SECTR_AudioEnvironment.
/// 
/// The goal of environmental audio (also known as ambient audio) is to create a base
/// layer of ambient sound effects, effects which always play even if there is not
/// much going on in the game.
/// 
/// In SECTR, AudioAmbiences contain two sets of cues that can help create this baseline.
/// Each AudioAmbience can have a background loop, which will be played
/// as a looping, 2D sound as long as that AudioAmbiences is the current, highest priority
/// AudioAmbiences in the scene. The AudioAmbiences can also have one or more one-shot
/// sounds that will fire randomly. If these one-shots are marked as Infinite3D,
/// then they will be randomly position in the surround field, giving the impression of
/// sounds playing all around the player.
