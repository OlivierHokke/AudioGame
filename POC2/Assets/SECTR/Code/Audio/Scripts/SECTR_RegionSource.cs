/// Playes a SECTR_AudioCue within a 3D volume.
/// 
/// It's often desirable to represent a sound not as a single point, but as an entire region of
/// space. RegionSources make that possible by efficiently computing the nearest point on the spline to the active
/// listener, and positioning its sound instance at that location. This creates a very convincing
/// illusing of the sound eminating from the entire spline, while using only one actual audio instance.
/// 
/// RegionSource supports any collider that Unity allows. However, for performance reasons it will default to
/// using the AABB of whatever collider is used. If more accuracy is desired, raycasting can be enabled, which
/// will determine the exact closest point (at some additional CPU cost.
